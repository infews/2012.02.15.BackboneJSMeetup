# 2011.12.08 Catro Street Startup Slide

Are you interested in Backbone? Are you test driving your JavaScript?

Jasmine is a BDD/unit testing framework for JavaScript that works just fine with Backbone.js projects.

This presentation has a quick introduction to Jasmine, then gives some tips, tricks, and patterns for using Jasmine with Backbone.

I gave this talk at the [Castro Street Startup Slide](http://www.meetup.com/startupslide/). Thanks to Ben Curren for the opportunity to speak.

Like all of my talks, this was built using [Keydown](http://github.com/infews/keydown). To view, you need to clone locally and open slides.html in an HTML5-happy browser.
